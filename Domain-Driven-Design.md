# Introduction

- For most software projects, the primary focus should be on the domain and domain logic
- Complex domain designs should be based on a model

Xtreme Programming is was the most promiment agile process at the time, it rebelled against the burdens of projects with useless static documents and obsessive amount of upfront planning. It followed with the design philosphy to use "the simplest thing that can work"
Minimalism that was refreshing in the midst of all the domain driven designers

There are two key concepts to apply domain driven design

1. Development is iterative
2. Developers and domain experts have a close relationship

# Overview
  
Domain Driven Design offers an abstraction to the messiness of software design. It offers enough information to serve a particular purpose, much like a movie showing only the important scenes and cutting out the regular unedited real life.
  
## Ingredients for effective modeling
  
1. Binding the model and the implementation (and maintained through all subsequent iterations)
2. Cultivating a language based on the model
3. Developing a knowledge-rich model
4. Distilling the model
5. Brainstorming and experimenting

Use of diagrams must educate developers what's pertinent to the domain, without overloading it with technical jargon that would not appear in code.

> If the design, or some central part of it, does not map to the domain model, that model is of little value, and the correctness of the software is suspect. At the same time, complex mapings between models and design functions are difficult to understand and, in practice, impossible to maintain as the design changes.

> The model is the backbone of a language when tackling complex domains. Commiting to exercising that language in diagrams, writing and even speech.

# Modeling

> Any technical person contributing to the model must spend some time touching the code, whatever primary role he or she plays on the project. Anyone responsible for changing code must learn to express model through the code. Every developer must be involved in some level of discussion about the model and have contact with domain experts. Those who contribute in different ways must consciously engage those who touch the code in a dynamic exchange of model ideas through the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE.

Complex applications should be kept in a Layered Architecture.
Each layer must be cohesive and depends only on the layers below.

Most code related to the domain model is isolated to one layer and must be free from the UI, application or infrastructure code.  
This will alow the model to become rich and clear enough to capture essential business knowledge.
