Children tend to ask a lot of questions. As adults we start to lose a bit of that curiousity

> "Why is the sky blue?" "Why do birds fly?" "But... WHY?" ðŸ˜³

Understanding work challenges sometimes needs more "Why?", five times.
Assume we have been working hard to finish a project. But the deadline arrives and its not done yet? 

It's time to embrace the inner child and ask "why?"

Invite the affected parties to a meeting, and present the problem.
Ask **"WHY?"** no less than 5 times.

**Example:**
- WHY was the deadline missed?
=> Because the final approval was delayed

- WHY was the final approval delayed
=> Because the client took longer than expected to review it

- WHY did the client take longer to review
=> Because they were unclear on what feedback was needed

- WHY were they unclear on the feedback needed?
=> Because we didn't provide clear review guidelines

- WHY didn't we provide clear review guidelines
=> Because we assumed they knew the process instead of outlining expectations
