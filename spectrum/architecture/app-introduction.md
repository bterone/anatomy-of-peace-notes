Spectrum is a platform where it combines the best of forums and real-time chat to form communities.

Each community can have a number of channels for users to chat in.

As a user, they can join any number of channels or communities.

Each channel or community can have their own custom settings, E.g. A community can have a setting to have their login be announced with a message using the `brandedLogin`.

Communities have tighter control on who creates them and must be created through the GraphQL API.
